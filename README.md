## Turn-Taking and Entropy Module
This module contains code and discussion for quantifying turn-taking behavior in multi-party interactions (in this case, 3 people). After some basic calculations of gap/overlap and speaker dominance. 
The second part of the module goes into calculating entropy, or the stability of turn exchanges. I show how to calculate entropy of turn-taking timing (i.e., how stable are the turn-transitions), as well as the entropy of speaker exchanges (i.e., how stable are the patterns with which speakers take the floor). 
These entropy patterns are related to measures of collaborative problem solving, using an open dataset. 

## Files
The module uses Jupyter notebooks so you can work along and play with the code, as well as html. The "TurnTaking_module.ipynb" has some open "do it yourself" sections to try out plotting the data in different ways. The files with "_withPlottingSolutions" in the name have this done for you.
